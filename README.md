# Advent of Code

## What is Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language.

## Repository
I have decided to participate in Advent of Code for the first time in 2022. This repository contains my AoC puzzle solutions written in various programming languages, including programming languages I commonly use (Java, JavaScript, Python) and some which I'm still learning (e.g. Rust, Go).
